The Path Forward initiative stimulates change within our complex health care ecosystem by leveraging data-driven employer purchasing strategies and incentivizing partners to increase access to new care models proven to cut costs and save lives. The second initiative, Shatterproof, leverages these same private sector actors to change addiction treatment. Join this conversation to learn more from the architects of these invaluable initiatives. "

A broad coalition of groups spanning the ideological spectrum have been working to oppose bills that would undermine donor privacy and have contributed to significant legislative and judicial victories.

Now, the Trojan Horse of cancel culture and “wokeness” is at the door of the education reform movement, threatening the charter and choice-based schools that donors have tirelessly supported to give students opportunities they would not have had otherwise. What can donors do to ensure that students are still able to think for themselves and access honest conversations and diversity of thought? This critical discussion will advise donors on how they can protect the charter and choice-based institutions they support from this harmful trend and more importantly, the students those institutions ultimately serve."

The COVID-19 crisis has intensified the ways such policies constrict demand and prevent patients from getting the care they need. Emergency measures have been passed to reform these policies in response to the crisis.
